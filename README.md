# CourierMS
A courier management system (CMS) is a software solution that helps courier companies manage their operations more efficiently. It automates many of the tasks involved in the courier process, such as order booking, dispatching, tracking, and delivery. This can free up courier staff to focus on other important tasks, such as customer service and improving delivery efficiency.
